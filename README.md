# 365 commits 
My journey learning C++ and graphics programming for game development.

## Goals
- Master C++ fundamentals → Linear Algebra → Graphics Programming → Game Engine
- I'm only allowed to skip a day if I previously made 2 commits the day before the one I'm skipping. 

## Progress
### Month 1: C++ Fundamentals 
- [x] Day 1: Basic calculator
- [x] Day 2: Added validations to the calculator 
- [x] Day 3: Initiated a vector calculator using c-arrays, the main structure and the function in charge of making the vectors are finished.
- [x] Day 4: Made a function in charge of choosing the c-arrays that it will be used on the adding and subs vectores function.
- [x] Day 5: Did exercises to better understand arrays and indexing.
- [x] Day 6: More exercises. 
- [x] Day 7: Finished vectors sum and required validations.
- [x] Day 8: Short magnitude exercise using the cmath library.
- [x] Day 9: Short dot product exercise returninig escalar. 
- [x] Day 10: Finished Vector calculator using c-arrays.
- [x] Day 11: Introduction de std::vector, study day. 
- [x] Day 12: Matrix 3x3 with std::vector, study day. 
- [x] Day 13: Did functions exercises to fully comprenhend parameters and return value functions. 
- [x] Day 14: Started pointers chapter; L-References and R-references.
- [x] Day 15: L-references and R-references.
- [x] Day 16: &-references and functions. 
- [x] Day 17: &-references and functions again. 
- [x] Day 18: random number given exercise, just for fun. 
- [x] Day 19: Pointers - study day. 
- [x] Day 20: Pointers exercise.
- [x] Day 21: Pointers exercise. 
- [x] Day 22: Pointers exercise. 
- [x] Day 23: Pointers exercise. 
- [x] Day 24: c-math library, due to studying trigonometry. 
- [x] Day 25: Sin function graph. 
- [x] Day 26: nullptrs and pointers exercise. 
- [x] Day 27: Trigonometry exercise table. 
- [x] Day 28: Pointers pass functions, NOT DONE.
- [x] Day 29: Began chapter 13 enums & structs.
- [x] Day 30: enums to strings transform. 
- [x] Day 31: enums to strings use. 

### Month 2: C++ Fundamentals. 
- [x] Day 01: strucst introduction and exercise. 
- [x] Day 02: structs exercise and i|o operator overloading. (thanks pedro)



### Current Focus
Learning C++ fundamentals and studying vectors. 

## Observations 
Changed the way we studied, since i felt some basic comprehensions were needed prior std::vector.
