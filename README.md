# 365 commits 
My journey learning C++ and graphics programming for game development.

## Goals
- Master C++ fundamentals → Linear Algebra → Graphics Programming → Game Engine
- I'm only allowed to skip a day if I previously made 2 commits the day before the one I'm skipping. 

## Progress
### Month 1: C++ Fundamentals 
- [x] Day 1: Basic calculator
- [x] Day 2: Added validations to the calculator 
- [x] Day 3: Initiated a vector calculator using c-arrays, the main structure and the function in charge of making the vectors are finished.

### Current Focus
Learning C++ fundamentals.
