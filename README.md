# 365 commits 
My journey learning C++ and graphics programming for game development.

## Goals
- Master C++ fundamentals → Linear Algebra → Graphics Programming → Game Engine
- I'm only allowed to skip a day if I previously made 2 commits the day before the one I'm skipping. 

## Progress
### Month 1: C++ Fundamentals 
- [x] Day 1: Basic calculator
- [x] Day 2: Added validations to the calculator 
- [x] Day 3: Initiated a vector calculator using c-arrays, the main structure and the function in charge of making the vectors are finished.
- [x] Day 4: Made a function in charge of choosing the c-arrays that it will be used on the adding and subs vectores function.
- [x] Day 5: Did exercises to better understand arrays and indexing.
- [x] Day 6: More exercises. 
- [x] Day 7: Finished vectors sum and required validations.
- [x] Day 8: Short magnitude exercise using the cmath library.
- [x] Day 9: Short dot product exercise returninig escalar. 
- [x] Day 10: Finished Vector calculator using c-arrays.



### Current Focus
Learning C-arrays and it's manipulation. 
Learning C++ fundamentals.

## Observations 
Day 4: quite some bugs, they will be fixed.
